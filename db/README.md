Imagebreed DB_patches

We forked the breedbase and identified the imagebreed db_patches from it. As a result, we realized the patches between 00132 and 00165 pertain to imagebreed.
After that, I checked each file in these folders with the breedbase db_patches. And only the files specific to imagebreed are kept, and the rest are deleted.
As a result, in order to distinguish imagebreed db_patches from breedbase, we numbered them from 10001 to 10033. 

# ImageBreed DB_Patches
